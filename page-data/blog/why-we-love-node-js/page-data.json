As software development team we‚Äôre often asked to advise on this matter. And well, it always depends on the project. However, more often than not, we suggest Node JS as a good solution, and I‚Äôll tell you why.\nWhy might Node.js be the right choice for your startup?\nIn my opinion, there are at least 3 reasons:</p>\n<h2>Node.js provides faster delivery</h2>\n<p>We strongly believe in lean startup methodology, which fundamentally focuses on fast delivery of prototypes to test the concepts underlying a startup‚Äôs business. We believe Node.js helps to achieve this.\nFirst, by sharing model code and tests between the client (say browser) and server, which constitutes a significant efficiency for a developer.\nSecond, Node.js excels as a ‚Äúframework‚Äù for apps providing real-time experience or streaming. This relates to features like chats, transactions, reservations or some forms of advertising. Handling these in a JavaScript-based event-driven environment is easy. Sometimes even too easy.\nWhat we also love when working with Node.js there is no mismatch between the backend and the frontend in terms of communication. That is, they work the same on both sides (JSON everywhere).\nNone of the above are game changers but they all save time, what is essential for a startup to stay lean. (I‚Äôm intentionally not mentioning ready components available via NPM, as other platforms also offer tools like Composer or Gem. Though, we do like NPM more)</p>\n<h2>Node.js enables us to pivot faster</h2>\n<p>Startus do pivot\nStartups do pivot, i.e. change fundamental parts of their business model as a process of measuring and learning.\nOur experiences show that introduction of substantial changes to an application, as a result of business model change, happens smoother when the application model is based on Node.js‚Äôs event-driven model rather than a classic MVC (at least in most cases).\nFaster startup pivoting is also partially related to Node‚Äôs partner in crime, MongoDB. As MongoDB is schema-less, we find the startup data storing significantly faster to alter when new business processes need to be handled by the application.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1250px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/gatsby-blog-site/static/b393e7c54119e49d5cff40b553efc105/04467/nodejs-2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 31.903276131045246%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"nodejs-2\"\n        title=\"nodejs-2\"\n        src=\"/gatsby-blog-site/static/b393e7c54119e49d5cff40b553efc105/66fdb/nodejs-2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/gatsby-blog-site/static/b393e7c54119e49d5cff40b553efc105/aa65c/nodejs-2.jpg 313w,\n/gatsby-blog-site/static/b393e7c54119e49d5cff40b553efc105/dfe3c/nodejs-2.jpg 625w,\n/gatsby-blog-site/static/b393e7c54119e49d5cff40b553efc105/66fdb/nodejs-2.jpg 1250w,\n/gatsby-blog-site/static/b393e7c54119e49d5cff40b553efc105/e25b1/nodejs-2.jpg 1875w,\n/gatsby-blog-site/static/b393e7c54119e49d5cff40b553efc105/08688/nodejs-2.jpg 2500w,\n/gatsby-blog-site/static/b393e7c54119e49d5cff40b553efc105/04467/nodejs-2.jpg 2564w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Node.js scales easily</h2>\n<p>The goal is to build a killer startup that is scalable both in terms of business model and technology. Contrary to what some developers say, we do not find the Node.js/Javascript TECHNOLOGY to be more scalable than PHP, Ruby or Python. In fact, in some cases it might be even less scalable.\nHowever, the benefit of Node.js is that is simply WAY easier to scale. Meaning that is close to scalable just out-of-the-box ‚Äì you do not have to do the magic start handling the scale.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Decision whether to do a project using a particular technology is hard. My advice is: keeping your startup lean (business-wise) is an important technical requirement. If so, Node.js might just be the right suit for your company.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"why-we-love-node-js"}}}
